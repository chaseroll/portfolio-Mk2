## 01. Personal Essay

    - "Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others (650 Words Max)."

    "Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore." - Andre Gide


     Homeschooling has served as both my anchor and compass.  As I matured, my mother afforded me greater autonomy over my education, with an aim to orient me to the North Star of self-organization and drive.  However, as is often the case with unfettered freedom, I strayed, enticed by the allure of video games and social media. The days began to blur into a haze, creating an illusion of endless tomorrows.

     Inevitably, my academic edge dulled, gradually overshadowed by the looming clouds of underachievement.  As I lay adrift, I grew to resent the very behavior my independence had fostered, recognizing it as a siren's song pulling me into a vortex of procrastination and laxity.  As this disconcerting introspection punctuated my mind, I discovered a beacon for change: the tide of self-accountability and the resurgent desire for purpose.

     Adjusting my heading was no trivial endeavor.  The shackles of entrenched habits made every stride toward discipline feel ephemeral.  However, amidst these tempestuous waters, an astronaut's perspective reframed my world.  Chris Hadfield's masterclass kindled a passion for the cosmos, painting visions of galaxies and the symphony of celestial bodies.

     While space exploration enamored me, my growing admiration for luminaries like Einstein and Feynman directed my gaze inwards.  Their work hinted at a journey where the mind could sail more expansive seas than the body ever could. This concept compelled me to immerse myself in the study of physics through every medium available to me.  Yet, another pivotal adjustment followed a visit to the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

     During this trip I discovered the vast and intricate harbor of engineering.  As I found myself surrounded by the marvels of aerospace and its promising frontiers, a new burning curiosity ignited within me.  Drawn further into the study of rocketry, I began to design and build small-scale hybrid rocket engines - a merger of my love for physics, space, and engineering.

     Eminent aerospace moguls like Elon Musk emerged as guiding constellations.  To me, Musk epitomizes the confluence of diverse fields and business acumen, transforming innovative ideas into tangible realities.  Inspired by him, I was driven to amalgamate my myriad interests with entrepreneurial ventures, further shaping my aspirations.

     ​​With vast horizons stretching before me, I have angled my sails to harness the winds of artificial intelligence, aiming to spearhead innovations in propulsion, communication, energy, and beyond.  Understanding the murky waters that lie ahead, I have sharpened my focus, fortified my resolve, and committed myself to pilot through these uncharted waters.

     Setting sail, I’ve launched Helios, an AI-driven productivity tool crafted for those striving to instill discipline and order in their lives.  It is the keel upon which I will lay the knowledge and skills essential for broader and more ambitious expeditions.

     My life’s next port of call, university, promises to deepen my understanding, nurture my curiosity, and foster a network of like-minded individuals.  My endeavors with Helios, combined with future projects and academic pursuits, will chart the course to the realization of my dreams.


     Undeniably, a challenging, perhaps perpetual, odyssey lies ahead.  Yet, buoyed by Elon Musk's maxim, "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor," I am anchoring myself in university, openly welcoming the great unknown.  For it is in the voyage toward the seemingly unattainable that one discovers true meaning, and in its embrace, the spirit triumphs amidst the turbulent seas.

## 02. Georgia Tech Essay

    - “Why do you want to study your chosen major specifically at Georgia Tech (300 Words Max).”



   The decision to ground my academics at Georgia Tech is a marriage of fervor and thoughtful strategy.  I envision my university years not merely as a transitional period, but as fertile ground where my unbridled curiosity can intertwine with the structured acquisition of knowledge.  These convictions led me towards selecting physics as my major and electrical engineering as a minor, while concurrently engaging in a rigorous self-driven study of mechanical engineering and computer science.

   I'm drawn to physics as it is the bedrock upon which our understanding of the universe rests, promising profound insights that can fuel future technological breakthroughs. While I am interested in courses like PHYS 4782, Quantum Information and Quantum Computing, I have yet to discover my precise focus within physics.  One very appealing aspect of Georgia Tech is the extensive scope and scale of its Physics Department, allowing for specialization in many niche fields without the need to transfer to another school.

   Moreover, Georgia Tech, being a specialized institution itself, naturally houses a community involved in STEM.  This environment, coupled with student-directed clubs and personal projects, provides a strong complement to my self-studying endeavors.  The endorsement from my Scoutmaster, an alumni of the Electrical Engineering program, further underscores Georgia Tech as an ideal setting for advancing my education.

     As an institution that values excellence and innovation, Georgia Tech aspires to cultivate “leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition,” creating a community committed to pushing the boundaries of what is considered achievable.  Georgia Tech will not merely fulfill my educational ambitions, but also bolster my growth, both personally and professionally.  I aim to become an integral part of Georgia Tech’s innovative and ever-growing community, with a desire to give back as much as I receive.

## 03. Univeristy of Florida Essay

    - “Please provide more details on your most meaningful commitment outside of the classroom while in high school and explain why it was meaningful. This could be related to an extracurricular activity, work, volunteering, an academic activity, family responsibility, or any other non-classroom activity (250 Words Max).”


   Many experiences have contributed to my growth, but one self-directed project stands out: Helios, a productivity app born from my struggle for discipline and a compelling desire to assist others confronting similar challenges.

   In my pursuit of discipline and efficiency, I have come across various apps for time management, fitness, and motivation. Each was helpful, but all were limited and lacked a comprehensive approach. I saw an opportunity to make an impact.

   I envisioned combining the best elements from each of these apps and elevating them with Artificial Intelligence. This concept was the impetus for the creation of Helios, a cross platform, customizable, AI-driven app with a simple and aesthetic interface. It features tools like a dynamic timeline, project manager, personalized training and nutrition plans, and comprehensive analytical insights.

   Helios’s AI capabilities personalize users' experiences, adapting to individual needs and goals based on user data. For instance, the app might suggest a specific workout or study schedule optimized for goals and previous success rates of the individual. Additionally, Helios facilitates community interaction, allowing users to share milestones, exchange tips, or engage in custom competitions and challenges.

   The development of Helios has been an incredible hands-on education far beyond the scope of traditional academics. I was introduced to UI/UX design, business strategy, and refined my programming skills. Moreover, collaborating with design experts and CEOs — whether for feedback, troubleshooting, or ideas — has been a phenomenal networking experience.  This project is underway and is slated to launch in early spring 2024.

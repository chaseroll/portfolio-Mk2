## Multimedia Assignment 1:

**Identity**: Richard Feynman, a renown physicist, comes across as both a brilliant scientist and a relatable teacher. He shows his deep passion and curiosity as well as being open about not possessing all the answers.

**Rhetorical Strategies**: Feynman uses simple analogues to bring enormously complex analytic ideas easy to grasp and comprehend. To give an example, he compares magnetic attraction to rubber bands to help visualize and build an intuition for the concept. He also employs thoughtful questions to keep his audience engaged and to show that science is about asking "why" over and over again as opposed to the mere regurgitation of a textbook.

**Identity and Power Dynamics**: Feynman balances his obvious expertise with being down-to-earth. While he clearly knows a lot about physics, he doesn’t act superior or distant. Instead, he acknowledges the limits of what he can explain, which levels the playing field and makes the audience feel more comfortable. By doing this, he invites people to think and discover alongside him rather than simply taking his word for it.

**Contextual Variation**: Feynman’s way of explaining concepts varies depending on who he’s talking to. In this video, he’s addressing a general, layman audience, so he keeps his language simple and uses familiar concepts as illustrations. He touches on the idea that if he were talking to a physics student, he could dive much deeper into the technical details. This exemplifies his ability to excited even the layman about the most intricate ideas of physics.

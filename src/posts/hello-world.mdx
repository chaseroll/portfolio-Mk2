## How It All Started:

When I encountered [Shawn Victor's portfolio](https://www.shawnvictor.net), I was immediately inspired to create a personal website of my own. My vision was to create a space that would not only serve as a repository for my projects but also a place where I could share the lessons learned from them. With university applications and future internships just around the corner, I realized that this site could also double as a personal introduction and resume.


## Baby Steps:

My initial web development efforts were with Wordpress as it seemed like quick and easy solution. However, I soon hit a wall with its limitations, particularly in terms of customization. This lack of flexibility became a significant drawback.


## Take Two:

That's when I decided to transition to [`React.js`](https://react.dev) to maximize flexibility. Because I was still new to web development, I opted to not start from scratch but rather to build on an already existing template made by [Hamash Williams](https://github.com/HamishMW/portfolio), modifying it to reflect my style and requirements. This approach allowed me to achieve the essence of what I was aiming for in a very short period of time.


## Looking Back and Forward:

Ultimately, the switch to React has proven to be beneficial as it has catalyzed dramatic improvement in my web development and design skills. As I set my eyes to the future, I'm excited to see how this website evolves alongside my personal development.
